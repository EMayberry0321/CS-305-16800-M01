**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?**

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for its customers. Artemis Financial wants to modernize its operations. As a crucial part of the success of its custom software, the company also wants to use the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a public web interface. The company is seeking Global Rain’s (my) expertise on how to protect its client data and financial information.

**What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?**

One part I believe I did well was checksum generation. Coding securely should be the most important aspect of any job, regardless of the scope of the project; ensuring the customers data security as well as that of the company, especially in an age where digital attacks/piracy are on the rise, should be considered during every step of the Software Development Life Cycle.

**Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**

For me, the most difficult portion of this assignment was reading and understanding the dependency report. I had never even looked at this prior to this class, so trying to read and understand the various parts of it was quite challenging.

**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**

to increase security, I would often find using multiple encryption algorithms to be the best practice. Different aspects all required different approaches depending on what was being requested.

**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**

After any changes I made, I would always run vulnerability checks to make sure I was not introducing any new vulnerabilities into the mix. And for functionality, I would test each portion of the code individually to make sure each step did what it was required to do, notating any failures or errors along the way

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**

The resource I found most helpful wasn't just one thing in particular, but rather a culmination of documents based around reading and understanding vulnerability reports to understand what each of the vulnerabilities meant. It was something I had never worked with before, so reading and studying it all seemed to make it easier to complete.

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**

Truthfully, I would show off my project 2 documentation and code. It was a great showcase of the skills we have refined in this class, and even though it wasn't fully functioning, I find its a great example of learning talents and growing based on mistakes.
